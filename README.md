# Typing-Speed-Calculator
This is a project based on JAVA where the goal of the project was to develop a code that could accurately provide us  with the number of words one can type according to the instructions provided. The tool provides the user with the  word per minute(WPM) count.
How It Works:
HTML: Provides the structure with a heading, prompt text, input area, and results display.
CSS: Styles the page with a modern, clean look.
JavaScript: Handles the typing logic, calculates WPM, errors, and accuracy, and dynamically updates the results.

How to Run:
Save the Java code to a .java file and run it on your local machine to test the command-line version.

For the web version:
Save the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in respective files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.
Open index.html in a web browser to run the typing test.
